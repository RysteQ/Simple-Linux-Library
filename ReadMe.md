# SLL - Simple Linux Library

SLL is a library for linux to make development in x86 assembly easier and safer


The current version (1.1.1) is a very early version as you can probably imagine, as time goes on more features will be added and more support, I will add support for 32bit x86 processors and even for ARM processors (if everything goes well that is).
